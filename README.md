# Setup

First of all, make sure you have downloaded the binary file for the selenium driver (either Chrome or Firefox) and added that to your system path, [How to get selenium](ttps://github.com/ucsb-cs56-pconrad/UCSB-CS56-pconrad.github.io/blob/master/_topics/selenium.md)

# Dependencies

# sparkjava-01

The simplest possible SparkJava web app (Hello World)

* [javadocs](https://ucsb-cs56-pconrad.github.io/sparkjava-01/apidocs/index.html)
* [web page generated by Maven (NOT THE WEB APP)](https://ucsb-cs56-pconrad.github.io/sparkjava-01/index.html).  This is simply documentation automatically generated by Maven, not the actual running web app.
